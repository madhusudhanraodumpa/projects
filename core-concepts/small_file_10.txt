            Authorization header with expected format: \"Authorization: Bearer \<access token\>\".
            If this header field is missing, the token is invalid or the token does not contain the required scopes, IAM-RS immediately responds status code 401 (missing or invalid) or 403 otherwise.
            Furthermore, it must contain the scopes which are required for the requested client type.
