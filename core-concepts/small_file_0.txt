  title: IAM Registration Service
  description: >-
    This is the API specification for the IAM Registration Service (IAM-RS).

    IAM-RS handles the creation of IAM registration tokens which can be used to register client instances at the IAM service.

    Please visit the IAM-RS Confluence page for more information on this service: https://confluence.trellix.com/display/CET/IAM+Registration+Service+Overview.

    The license endpoints in this API version are the same as the ones in API v1.1.
    The differences in the token and token-tenandid endpoint of this API version compared to API v1.2 is:

      * Parameter \"additional_claims\" at endpoint token-tenantid has been replaced by parameter \"additional_payload\" which has the same purpose as that parameter for the /dcr endpoint of IAM. That is, all (non-reserved) claims from the JSON sent via this parameter are added as additional payload to the registration token.
